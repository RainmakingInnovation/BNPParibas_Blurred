Opportunity Space,Definition,Insights
Asset Management,Startups that focus on growing customers wealth over time through traditional instruments,
Automated Savings,App based startups which automatically save money for users,
Goal Based Savings,Assists users in long term financial goals via habit changes,
Pensions Plan,Helps users access and optimise their pension programmes,"1. In comparison to other fintech startup categories, the pension startup space is relatively sparse with few competitors. However, there are large players that have gathered a large portion of the market (PensionBee), a partnership with them could provide BNP with a quick an easy access to the pensions space.;

2. Another unique area BNP could operate in is by targeting pension plans for employees. This is a niche market and not a traditional offering seen.; 

3. With COVID-19 impacting many individuals finances, bank branches closing and customer service waiting times increasing, the demand for traditional firms to offer a simplified and more transparent service offers BNP a potential area and case for pursuing this opportunity space."
Pooled Savings,Develops highly trusted savings communities and leverages social equity to borrow more quickly and efficiently,
Robo Advice,Automated allocation of savings and funds using minimal human intervention,
Savings Management,Ongoing management of savings,"1. High amount of interest but also competition within this opportunity space. Stash Invest is at a Series F round with over $300M in funding. For BNP, best choice would be to invest and partner with existing startups in this space as opposed to build given the high competition.;

2. Declining market activity for this space, 2019 only saw 1 startup reinforcing the hypothesis that the space is highly contested whereas 2015 saw $377M in funding distributed over 10 startups. This reaffirms the case that competition is high so BNP would be best positioned as an investor/partner for startups in this space vs venturing.;

3. Scam prevention would be an interesting business model to go for within this space. There are only 2 startups (Kalgera and Arnexa) without any funding. For BNP, this implies that savings management does still have space but they will need to niche down in order to find profitable pockets to play in. "
